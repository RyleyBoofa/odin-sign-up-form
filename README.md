# Odin Sign-Up Form

Sign-up form for an imaginary service, built as my solution to The Odin Project's [Project: Sign-Up Form](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form).
The goal of this project was to practice designing and styling HTML forms by recreating the sign-up form as seen in the reference image below.

Live preview can be found [here](https://ryleyboofa.github.io/odin-sign-up-form/).

## New skills used

-   HTML: Forms with various labels, input types, and constraints
-   CSS: Form styling, absolute and relative positioning, custom font-face, size and spacing with relative units
